            <h1>Customer testimonial: Bid for Wine</h1>
            <p>I am a bit obsessed with doing an excellent job for our clients and customers. I will bend over backwards and do anything that is required to ensure that everyone is delighted with the outcome of our projects.</p>

<p>As a result it is particularly satisfying when our customers recommend us warmly. I do not like bragging, but on this one occasion please let me quote Lionel Nierop from <a href='http://www.bidforwine.co.uk'>Bid for Wine</a> &#8211; they have been our client for around a year now, and have recently <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=12526586&amp;trk=tab_pro#recommendations'>written us a recommendation on LinkedIn</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have known Martin personally since meeting him at Corpus Christi college in Cambridge in 2003. He was widely known by his peers both as a deeply intelligent and analytical person (skills which saw him regularly coming top of the Computer Science Tripos) and as a great contributor to the life of the college through music and other means.</p>

<p>Our professional relationship began in June 2007 when I joined Martin in setting up his current business, Ept Computing. I left the business in January 2008 for personal reasons.</p>

<p>In March 2008 I put out a large web application project out to tender. This was for the development of an online wine auction site which had to be low maintenance and scalable. There were also a range of detailed requirements relating to tax administration and logistics. The brief was provided to 5 businesses including some major London firms but Ept was the only company to respond in a manner which showed a real understanding of the technical side of the project as well as a broader engagement with the concept as a whole.</p>

<p>The project was successfully delivered on time and on budget despite several major alterations and additions to the brief during the development phase. Martin always responded to these changes in a constructive manner and worked exceptionally hard to make sure he could see their relevance to the project in the round rather than simply as a technical issue to overcome. This was key to the success of the project as it meant we did not have to explicitly detail the minutiae of every change but could rely on Martin to develop the application in a manner which considered the underlying needs of the user. His strong work ethic and personal skills made us feel that Martin was very much a member of our team, rather than simply a contractor and our commercial relationship continues to go forward in a constructive and mutually beneficial manner.</p>

<p>Service Category: IT Consultant; Year first hired: 2008; Top Qualities: Great Results, Personable, Creative</p>

<p>Thanks Lionel, it has been great to work with you, and I look forward to continuing it further!</p>
