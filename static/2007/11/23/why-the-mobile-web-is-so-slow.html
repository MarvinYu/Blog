                Why the mobile web is so slow
            </h1>

            <p>On the &#8220;desktop/laptop web&#8221; (in contrast to the mobile web), we&#8217;ve become used to a page loading in about a second. On mobile phones, we are still far from seeing anything near that responsiveness &#8211; for most people, the mobile web experience is still agonisingly slow. Personally, I start to get irritated after about five seconds, and after as little as ten seconds there is a strong chance that I will go away and do something else. And currently it&#8217;s still a challenge to get a page to load within that timeframe on a mobile.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why it is so slow? Yesterday I was reading a few articles, and I repeatedly came across people who made a very simplistic assumption: namely that the available network bandwidth is fully used. For example, they will say: on a standard 3G/UMTS connection, each subscriber can transfer 384 kbit/s, therefore a 24 kB web page (text and a few small pictures) will load in 0.5 seconds. Honestly, if you&#8217;ve <em>ever</em> tried to access even a simple web page from a phone you know that this figure is just laughably wrong. It is <em>never</em> that fast.</p>

<p>Finally, after lots of searching, I found <a href='http://research.microsoft.com/~pablo/papers/www04.pdf'>this paper</a> by <a href='http://blog.rodriguezrodriguez.com/'>Pablo Rodriguez</a>, <a href='http://www1.bell-labs.com/user/sarit/'>Sarit Mukherjee</a> and Sampath Rangarajan. And they give some good reasons why this is the case:</p>

<ul>
<li>The round-trip time for packets is between 400 and 1000 ms in a typical 3G cell.</li>

<li>Packets loss is inevitable in wireless transmissions because of radio interference. There are two approaches to packet loss: either let TCP deal with retransmission (in which case it thinks the network is congested, and reduces the transfer rate), or to retransmit lost packets in a low-level protocol (in which case the round-trip times observed by TCP can vary wildly, which confuses TCP and also reduces the transfer rate).</li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, TCP is really not up to the job, but it&#8217;s so widely used that there is basically no chance that it is going to be replaced anytime so on. (WAP included a layer called the <a href='http://www.protocols.com/pbook/wap.htm'>Wireless Transaction Protocol</a>, which attempted to be a better replacement for TCP. But we know what happened to WAP &#8211; nobody wants to use it.) In their paper, Rodriguez et al. go on to describe a method for partially getting round the problem by rewriting DNS and HTTP responses &#8211; it&#8217;s not ideal, but at least it removes some of the worst problems.</p>

<p>The real problem here is that round-trip time though. On a normal broadband connection I&#8217;d expect a round-trip time between 25 ms (within the UK) and 125 ms (across the Atlantic). On 3G, even though the bandwidth is not that much lower than broadband, we&#8217;ve got a round-trip time 8 to 15 times higher. And this time really becomes noticeable every time you click on a link:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send a DNS request for the hostname we want to contact, and wait for the response. (Unless we&#8217;ve cached the DNS record on the handset.)</li>

<li>Send a TCP SYN packet to the server we want to contact, and wait for the response.</li>

<li>Send the HTTP query over the established TCP connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that every time we click a link, we have to wait 2 or 3 round trip times &#8211; i.e. between 0.8 and 3.0 seconds &#8211; until we get the very first few bytes of the page we requested. That&#8217;s assuming that none of those first few packets got lost (because if one of them was lost, there would be no way of telling &#8211; all you can do is wait for a timeout and try again). And then we still have to transfer the whole page, and have all the TCP issues to deal with.</p>

<p>I just hope that mobile phones nowadays use <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection'>persistent HTTP connections</a> or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining'>pipelining</a> which would remove some of the overheads. Does anybody know if they do? I&#8217;d like to hear from you.</p>

<p>PS. I thought I had accidentally deleted this post &#8211; fortunately I managed to find it again, hidden away in a binary mess, in the MySQL log file! :-)</p>
