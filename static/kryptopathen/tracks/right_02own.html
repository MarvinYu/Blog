<br>
The numbers on the news<br>
they ever rise and analyze<br>
what you may lose<br>
no future if you're not the best<br>
in the test, and the rest<br>
can they choose?<br>
<br>
Don't let this get you down<br>
and don't imagine what they say<br>
will make you bound<br>
to future. No destiny<br>
you are free, you will see<br>
stand your ground!<br>
<br>
You've got to be strong and free<br>
be what you want to be<br>
do what you like with passion, peace and play<br>
everyone is special in his own way...<br>
<br>
Hold on, you're being made<br>
a simple figure, small or bigger<br>
status, grade<br>
So easy to calculate<br>
regulate, investigate and persuade.<br>
<br>
Don't let this get you down<br>
and don't imagine what you do<br>
will make you bound<br>
to future. No destiny<br>
you are free, you will see<br>
stand your ground!<br>
<br>
<i>2x</i>
<br>
You've got to be strong and free<br>
be what you want to be<br>
even if you're stopped and given no pay<br>
everyone is special in his own way...<br>
