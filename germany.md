Sketching the German mindset

Imagine you're a young adult, got your driving license, got your first car. You love it. The
incredible sense of freedom, since you no longer need to ask your parents to drive you everywhere.
You love the force pushing you into your seat when you push down hard on the accelerator. The sense
of power when you rev the engine.

You quickly gain experience, and you think you're a pretty good driver. You drive fast, but safely.
You know where the speed cameras are and how to avoid them. Your friends think you're the coolest
guy in town.

Then, one day, bad luck strikes. As you're going round a corner fast, you hit another car. It's a
nasty accident -- the other driver was going fast too, going dangerously around that corner, and you
simply didn't see the other car in time. The other car's driver recovers from his injuries, but
sadly, his passenger is badly injured in the accident, and she dies in hospital.

The family of the other car's passenger think that you were driving recklessly, and sue you. A court
decides that the accident was at least partly your fault, and condemns you to paying damages to the
killed woman's family. It's a lot of money. You are angry -- the other car was going fast too, why
do you get all the blame? You already had to write off your old car, and the down payment on the new
car has eaten up all your savings. The damages payments are going to force you to really tighten
your belt.

In rage about the whole thing, you drive home. The roads are congested; everyone is driving so badly
today. Random car pulls ahead of you, even though you have right of way. Another driver suddenly
cuts into the lane before you, forcing you to slam on the brakes. Pedestrian walks out onto the
street without looking -- you open the window and scream at them, what the hell they think they are
doing. What on earth is going on today?

At a busy junction, you've been stuck in traffic for ages, you finally pull out and turn. Some
movement in the corner of your eye -- you don't know what's happening -- screeching brakes -- a
sudden jolt -- you're moving fast -- try to steer back onto the road -- shouting -- losing control
of the car -- it's all happening so quickly -- slipping down a steep slope -- terrible scraping
sounds -- and before you know what's happening, your new car has crashed into a petrol station,
terrible fumes, you manage to climb out of the car and run, something catches fire, and within a
minute everything is ablaze.

The fire spreads to neighbouring buildings, three people are killed, including a two-year-old child,
and seven more people are injured by the noxious smoke.

You are mortified. You have no idea how that could have happened. This time, the court assigns you a
psychologist, and you spend many long hours talking.

Years pass, and the shock gradually fades into memory. You are still shaken; occasionally you wake
from nightmares of crashing steel and blazing flames, finding yourself soaked in cold sweat. But you
know that you cannot undo what has happened. The four lives, claimed as a result of your actions,
will not return. Slowly, gradually, you learn to come to terms with it.

But there is no doubt that the incident has changed your life forever. You very rarely drive these
days -- you don't even own a car, you just rent one on the rare occasion that you need to go out
into the countryside. Otherwise, you can go everywhere you need by bike or by train. You're not
neurotic about it, you just prefer it that way.

In fact, you've become a campaigner for cycling to work -- not only is it greener, but you also
build up some muscles and you don't get stuck in traffic. And taking the train is so obviously more
pleasant than driving long distances. You wonder why anyone would want to drive at all.

Perhaps hard to believe that you, who was once such a car fanatic, now prefers to sit in the back
seat, and sometimes dreams of a world where there are no cars at all.

Your friends find it a bit strange. Why would you take a bus to Ikea, and take the bus back home
(carrying heavy bags full of household items), if it's much more convenient to drive? But for you,
it makes sense. You roll your eyes as people drive by in their big fat SUVs and flashy sports cars.
You've done some driving, and it wasn't for you.
