title: "Customer testimonial: Bid for Wine"
---

I am a bit obsessed with doing an excellent job for our clients and customers. I will bend over
backwards and do anything that is required to ensure that everyone is delighted with the outcome of
our projects.

As a result it is particularly satisfying when our customers recommend us warmly. I
do not like bragging, but on this one occasion please let me quote Lionel Nierop from
[Bid for Wine](http://www.bidforwine.co.uk) -- they have been our client for around a year now, and
have recently
[written us a recommendation on
LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=12526586&trk=tab_pro#recommendations):

<p><blockquote>I
have known Martin personally since meeting him at Corpus Christi college in Cambridge in 2003. He
was widely known by his peers both as a deeply intelligent and analytical person (skills which saw
him regularly coming top of the Computer Science Tripos) and as a great contributor to the life of
the college through music and other means.</p>

Our professional relationship began in June 2007 when I
joined Martin in setting up his current business, Ept Computing. I left the business in January 2008
for personal reasons.

In March 2008 I put out a large web application project out to tender. This
was for the development of an online wine auction site which had to be low maintenance and scalable.
There were also a range of detailed requirements relating to tax administration and logistics. The
brief was provided to 5 businesses including some major London firms but Ept was the only company to
respond in a manner which showed a real understanding of the technical side of the project as well
as a broader engagement with the concept as a whole.

The project was successfully delivered on
time and on budget despite several major alterations and additions to the brief during the
development phase. Martin always responded to these changes in a constructive manner and worked
exceptionally hard to make sure he could see their relevance to the project in the round rather than
simply as a technical issue to overcome. This was key to the success of the project as it meant we
did not have to explicitly detail the minutiae of every change but could rely on Martin to develop
the application in a manner which considered the underlying needs of the user. His strong work ethic
and personal skills made us feel that Martin was very much a member of our team, rather than simply
a contractor and our commercial relationship continues to go forward in a constructive and mutually
beneficial manner.
