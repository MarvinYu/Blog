title: "Learning about our customers"
---

Back in December I
[wrote about my realisation](/2009/12/31/how-we-totally-ignored-our-customers/) that we had not been
spending enough time learning about our customers at Go Test It. Since then, I have been working
hard to catch up in this area, and the last two months have been an incredible experience.

Although
there's still a long way to go, we have learnt a lot, and we are getting a much clearer idea of
where we need to go in future. And I feel that I am developing another startup skill which will no
doubt be valuable in future.

I will be writing about our customer discovery process and things we
have learnt in a series of blog posts on the
[Go Test It blog](http://go-test.it/blog). A slightly provocative teaser from my first post of the
series:

<blockquote>A startup's purpose is not to make money (at least not initially). Nor is its
purpose to build a product (although it won't go far without a product). No, the real reason why a
startup exists is to **learn** about potential customers and to define a
market.</blockquote>
