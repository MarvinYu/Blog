title: "User experience importance is being recognised"

Marketing professionals are finally beginning to understand the importance of designing a coherent
and positive user experience is an important part of online marketing.
[Usability News quotes](http://www.usabilitynews.com/news/article4050.asp) from
[a recent
report](http://www.e-consultancy.com/publications/usability-and-user-experience-report-2007/):
*"...the biggest benefits of usability investment are improved perceptions of brand, increased
conversion rates and greater customer loyalty and retention."*

However, there is still a long way
to go. Although usability is on the increase, there are still plenty of people who do not recognise
it. But the benefits are huge: the average e-commerce site can
[increase its sales by 79%](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010819.html) through a usability
overhaul, according to
[the world's leading user experience expert](http://www.usabilitynews.com/news/article4059.asp),
[Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/).

I discovered an unbelievable website today:
[UsabilityNet](http://www.usabilitynet.org/) is supposed to promote usability resources, but the
website is itself a usability nightmare. The whole page is in embedded Flash, and there is not even
a good reason for it. The navigation is totally confused, it looks ugly, and the button asking you
to complete a survey on the quality of the website just adds to the irony. In fact, it features as
one of the
[10 worst websites of 2007](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/worst-web-sites-of-2007.html) on
[Vincent Flanders' webpagesthatsuck.com](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/).
