title: "Ept Computing's website re-launched"

Hurrah, the
[new website of Ept Computing](http://www.eptcomputing.com/) is now online! It's taken us two months
to get there but I'm very pleased with the result. Thanks to
[Adam](http://www.therigu.co.uk/) for doing the design.

<p>We've not only thoroughly re-designed the
look and feel of the site to make it a lot more alive and stylish. We have also completely
re-written the entire content to bring it more in line with our goals as a company. Previously we
just had a rather handwavy blurb about what we do, but this is now a lot more concrete. We
do:
<ul>
<li>mobile web development/design (in particular, bringing e-commerce to the mobile
web)</li>
<li>usability and user experience
consulting</li>
<li>web application development.</li>
</ul>
I'm hoping this clear differentiation
will help us to give people a better idea of what we do, what we're passionate about and what we
believe in. We previously made the mistake of effectively saying something like "we can do anything,
just let us do it" -- a proposition which is impossible to sell. Now with this clearer view we
should be better off.</p>
