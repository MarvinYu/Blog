title: "Challenges of interface design for mobile devices"
---

The
[Yahoo user interface blog recently featured a good
post](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/10/02/challenges-of-interface-design-for-mobile-devices/)
introducing some of the limitations of designing for mobile devices. It points to the limitations of
both output (small screen) and input (keypad, touchscreen, joystick and many other variations), and
emphasises the most important basis for the design of mobile sites and services: keeping in mind the
context -- who the user is, where and when and how they are going to use the service. Outdoors in
difficult lighting conditions? On a train which goes through tunnels and therefore keeps losing its
network connection?
