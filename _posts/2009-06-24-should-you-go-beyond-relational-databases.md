title: "Should you go beyond relational databases?"
---

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet the excellent
[Ryan Carson](http://ryancarson.com/), the man behind the
[Carsonified](http://carsonified.com/) conferences like
[Future of Web Apps](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/). We got chatting about the future of
databases, and what lies beyond the relational model, and in the end Ryan asked me to write an
article for
[ThinkVitamin](http://thinkvitamin.com/), a widely-read blog for web
professionals.

<p><blockquote>Relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and various commercial
products, have served us well for many years. Lately, however, there has been a lot of discussion on
whether the relational model is reaching the end of its life-span, and what may come after
it.</p>

Should you care? Which database technology should you be using?

Of course the answer is *"it
depends"*, but that's not very helpful. Let me ask you a few questions to help you figure out which
technology is appropriate to *your* particular application. Then I can give a few pointers so that
you can find out more.</blockquote>

I am pleased that it is now published, so please
[head over to ThinkVitamin for the full
story](http://thinkvitamin.com/dev/should-you-go-beyond-relational-databases/), and let me know your
thoughts!
