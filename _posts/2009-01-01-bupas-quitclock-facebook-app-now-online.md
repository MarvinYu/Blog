title: "Bupa's 'Quitclock' Facebook app now online"
---

Just a brief note to say that the
[Quitclock Facebook application](http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=39245025835) which
I developed for the
[health insurance company Bupa](http://www.bupa.co.uk/) has now been officially launched ([see the
press
release](http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/171208_quitclock.html)).

Purpose
of the application is to help people who want to give up smoking. Users can enter the date when they
stopped smoking, and get updates on how much money they have saved, display a box on their profile,
get support messages etc. The application was launched now because many people try to give up
smoking as their new year's resolution.

The application is hosted on Google App Engine, marking my
first real-life use of GAE. It has been a bit frustrating at times, and I may post some more
comments about my App Engine experience at some later stage.
