Just been to
[BarCampBrighton 3](http://barcampbrighton.org/) and it was awesome. It was my first BarCamp and I'm
definitely taken by the idea.

The weekend has been full of new ideas, so I will just jot down a few
bullet points and links to some of the most interesting things before I forget.

<p>Coworking, social
connections between
freelancers:
<ul>
<li>[The Werks](http://thewerks.org.uk/), a coworking organisation in
Brighton</li>
<li>Coworking worldwide on the
[Coworking Wiki](http://coworking.pbwiki.com/)</li>
</ul>
Semantic Web, managing
structured/interconnected information (thanks to
[Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org/) for most of these
links):
<ul>
<li>[ONEIS](http://www.oneis.co.uk/) has an interesting-looking approach for storing
internal information within an organisation -- simple and flexible at the same
time.</li>
<li>[DBpedia](http://dbpedia.org/) has extracted structured information from Wikipedia,
put it into RDF form and allows various ways of navigating and displaying the
information.</li>
<li>Don't implement your own RDF parser (it's really quite complicated). Use
[Jena](http://jena.sourceforge.net/) (Java) or
[Redland](http://librdf.org/)
(C).</li>
<li>Use
[N3 (Notation 3)](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html) when writing RDF by hand to avoid
XML syntax
madness.</li>
<li>[FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) -- description of personal connections using
RDF. I heard of ages ago, but only gradually beginning to appreciate how useful it may be. (Social
networking without being locked into particular
sites?)</li>
<li>[VoCamp](http://vocamp.org/) (Vocabulary Camp), a BarCamp-style meeting in Oxford
where people get together to define ontologies for specific subject areas. Another camp planned in
London for
November?</li>
<li>[Fresnel](http://www.w3.org/2005/04/fresnel-info/) is a language to describe how
to display semantic web
data.</li>
<li>The
[National Library of Sweden](http://www.kb.se/hjalp/english/) makes its catalogue available in RDF.
E.g.
[Pippi](http://libris.kb.se/bib/10438681) in
[RDF/N3](http://libris.kb.se/data/bib/10438681?format=text%2Frdf%2Bn3) and
[RDF/XML](http://libris.kb.se/data/bib/10438681?format=application%2Frdf%2Bxml).</li>
<li>The
[Linking Open Data dataset cloud](http://richard.cyganiak.de/2007/10/lod/) diagram (linked
from [linkeddata.org](http://linkeddata.org/))</li>
</ul>
