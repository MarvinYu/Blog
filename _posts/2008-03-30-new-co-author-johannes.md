A warm welcome to Johannes Hauser, who is joining me as a co-author of this blog. Johannes has
contributed
[two](/2008/03/11/one-day-without-computers-and-digital-stuff-is-it-possible-part-1/)
[posts](/2008/03/16/one-day-without-computers-and-digital-stuff-is-it-possible-part-2/) and a number
of comments so far, with a particular focus on the interaction between technology and everyday life.
I hope that Johannes will give a bit of a balance to our content -- if I head off on a technology
tangent, he brings things back down to earth. I have worked with Johannes before and appreciate his
well-founded and clearly articulated opinions. We are looking forward to reading more from him on
Yes/No/Cancel over the coming weeks and months.
