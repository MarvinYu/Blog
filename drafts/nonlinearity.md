title: The law of startup non-linearities

How do you maximise success at your startup?

(What's the outcome you're trying to maximise? Expected financial return? Worst-case/best-case financial return?
Adventure? Celebrity? Fun? Respect of peers? ...)

Need some basis on which to decide whether to raise money / how much, when and at what terms; whether to give
someone advisor shares, etc.

Expected magnitude of personal success = shareholding/dilution * sum_{possibilities} ( probability * value )

Dilution generally increases 'smoothly' with the amount you raise. Probability of success does not.

Probability of success as a function of money/time: starts at 0, flat, jump upwards, (maybe some more jumps
upwards, with flat bits in between), then jump downwards [you have so much money that not just do you stand
a chance of IPOing large enough, but you also start doing things which are actively harmful].

Plug that function into the formula above, get an interesting-looking graph.

Goal: get on the right side of those jumps!

Metaphor: breaking a combination lock. You try various combinations, and it's not clear whether you are
making progress, but at some point you hit the right magic combination and suddenly everything takes off.
The outcome as a function of combinations is highly non-linear. [Of course startups are quite like cheap
locks, where an experienced lock-breaker can feel whether they've moved one of the cylinders into the right
place, so they can sense whether they are making progress in the right direction. Still, they only get the
value once they hit the right combination.] [That's the whole lean startup thing -- optimising for trying
lots of combinations, and getting a good feel for whether the cylinders are in the right place.]

Morals:
- being in the right ballpark is more important than micro-optimising the financial details
- giving substantial equity to guys like YC can make sense, because they have the power to push you across
  one of those discontinuities; whether they take 5% or 7% is not too important

Musing: does this also apply to product development? What is more likely to make a nonlinear jump in
users loving your product -- lots of small, incremental improvements, or a big, experimental (but maybe
not so well-executed) new feature? Note that here things are different, because incremental improvements
contribute strongly towards overall feeling towards the product; incremental improvements aren't additive
in the same way as money is.
