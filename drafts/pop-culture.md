Alan Kay: Computing is pop culture
==================================


> [Computing is a] complete pop culture. [...] Pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture
> is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with
> cooperation, the past or the future -- it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most
> people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from].

> I'm not against pop culture. Developed music, for instance, needs a pop culture. There's a
> tendency to over-develop. Brahms and Dvorak needed gypsy music badly by the end of the 19th
> century. The big problem with our culture is that it's being dominated, because the electronic
> media we have is so much better suited for transmitting pop-culture content than it is for
> high-culture content. I consider jazz to be a developed part of high culture. Anything that's been
> worked on and developed and you [can] go to the next couple levels.

> Binstock: One thing about jazz aficionados is that they take deep pleasure in knowing the history
> of jazz.

memes — in the narrow sense of captioned images shared on the internet, not in the broad sense
coined by Richard Dawkins.

internet meme = internet fad = not too different from a tradition. culturemaking.
“A tradition is a repeated social action or event within a specific cultural context that reflects
the society’s psychological, economic, and political needs.”

Different patterns of speech (such as slang) have been used to establish boundaries between
different social groups, and this practice is probably as old as language itself.

Pop culture does not want to be analysed (that would be "overthinking" it), just like a joke is
surely destroyed if you try to explain it. On the other hand, hard thinking, careful analysis and
clear reasoning is what high culture is all about.

Very few of the software engineers I know read research papers on any sort of regular basis, even on
topics they are very interested in. Some blame that on impenetrable academic writing style and
paywalls, but I find that hard to believe (most papers I have read recently have been quite well
written, and most have had open-access copies on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com)).

I think it's more likely that engineers don't read more about research because (a) it is hard to
discover good papers if you don't know where to start, and (b) reading a paper requires deeper and
more sustained attention than a typical blog post, which can be skimmed quickly during a lunch break
or while commuting. Sites like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) have a bias towards
timely, inflammatory opinion pieces -- and are not well suited if you want to find timeless,
insightful, carefully reasoned writing.

This, I guess, is an example of what Kay means when he says _"the electronic media we have is so
much better suited for transmitting pop-culture content than it is for high-culture content"_.

[Richard Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) tells the following
[anecdote](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html) about the lunch tables at Bell Labs:

> I went over and said, "Do you mind if I join you?" They can't say no, so I started eating with
> them for a while. And I started asking, "What are the important problems of your field?" And after
> a week or so, "What important problems are you working on?" And after some more time I came in one
> day and said, "If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead
> to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?" I wasn't welcomed after that; I
> had to find somebody else to eat with!

Sure, [real artists ship](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs), I get it. We have to build
things that are real and useful, not just theorise and philosophise -- no doubt about that. As a
call to overcome fear of failing, _real artists ship_ is a great motto. But there is also a risk of
short-termist thinking. I think that Alan Kay's key message is this: amongst all this
[shipping](https://twitter.com/dailydevtips), we should sometimes also take a few steps back and
ask: Are we actually working on the right problems? What are the most important problems we could be
working on? What can we learn from the many great thinkers who came before us? Is there a
fundamentally better way of doing this, like the grace of an arch compared to the heavyweight
pyramid?
