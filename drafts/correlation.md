title: When correlation causes causation
---

We all know that correlation does not imply causation. But, as [XKCD says](http://xkcd.com/552/),
"it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'".

Humans sometimes just act irrationally, i.e. something which shouldn't *rationally* have an effect
on our behaviour actually *does* influence it nevertheless. We humans often *want* to believe that
a correlation tells us something about causation, even while our logic-oriented left brain
hemisphere is sternly reminding us that causation is not implied and should not be assumed.

Things get particularly interesting when you have a system with a positive feedback loop, and
human decision-making as part of that feedback loop. In such systems, the feedback loop may take a
small amount of irrationality, and amplify it to produce very real effects.

Some examples:

* **Speculative bubbles**. They happen in
  [startups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) and
  [house prices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_bubble),
  but have existed for centuries --- Amsterdam experienced a bubble in
  [tulip bulb prices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) in 1637.
  People observe that the price of something is going up (a correlation between price and time),
  see that others are making fortunes overnight, and just *want* to believe that the rise is going
  to continue. Even people who ought to know better start overpaying for the resource, in the hope
  that the next person is going to overpay by even more; the demand drives up the price (until,
  eventually, the bubble bursts, and a lot of people go home feeling pretty stupid).

  Even though we know that past performance is no guarantee of future results, we see that
  upwards trend, and a small irrational belief whispers "hey, surely it'll continue for another
  bit". Combine small amounts of irrationality from lots of people, and sometimes a
  supply-constrained market will amplify it into a bubble; in small doses, this is called
  [momentum investing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing). The correlation starts
  reinforcing itself, and becomes a cause for itself.

* **Reputation of an institution**, for example a university. Imagine you're hiring for a job,
  and you see two CVs: one candidate went to the venerable University of Cambridge, whilst the
  other went to some local university you've never heard of. Both candidates got the same grades
  and are otherwise equivalent. Who do you interview first? Most likely the girl/guy from
  Cambridge, because of the university's good reputation.

  But where did that reputation come from? I'm not convinced that the teaching is really that
  much better than elsewhere. The main factor here is a signalling effect: Cambridge is
  comparatively hard to get into, and thus the candidate probably meets at least some minimum
  standard if they were able to get in. But why is it hard to get into Cambridge? Because lots
  of good students try. And they try to get in... because it has a good reputation.

  Those young people, who were bright and motivated when they applied to university, often
  continue to be motivated and bright, get jobs in which they can make a difference and be
  recognised for it, and sometimes go on to do widely-known, successful things. And before
  long, a correlation appears between Cambridge graduates and successful people (for some
  definition of success, e.g. [Nobel Prize winners](http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/nobelprize.html)).
  Whether the university contributed anything to those successes is unknown, but nor does it
  matter: people see that correlation, want to be successful too, apply to Cambridge, and the
  university gets to pick the best, which reinforces the correlation.

* **Startup investing.** When a well-known, respected investor puts money into your startup, lots
  of other people suddenly also want to give you their money. Why? Usually, an investor's
  reputation stems from their track record -- people look at their past investments and judge
  whether they were good at "picking the winners", i.e. whether their investment decisions were
  correlated with the success of the companies they invested in. No investor is perfect, but if
  they pick a few big winners, and not too many of the others fail, their portfolio can generate a
  positive return overall. Copying the decisions of someone who has made good choices in the past
  seems like a
  [reasonably sound strategy](http://www.quora.com/Is-social-proof-a-rational-approach-to-investment-selection)
  (at least in the absence of anything better).

  When several people follow the lead of another investor, a self-reinforcing effect emerges:
  demand to "be in the deal" increases, it becomes "hot", other highly-regarded investors start
  taking interest, and so on, until the round is oversubscribed. With some highly connected,
  influential people on board, the startup's chances of success are increased, and if it indeed
  turns out to be successful, the investors' good reputation is further cemented. And voil√†, the
  initial correlation of investments and successes in the investors' portfolios has caused that
  correlation to be reinforced.


What these examples show is that sometimes the mere presence of a correlation can cause the
correlation to reinforce itself. No matter what network of causes and effects previously
surrounded the correlation (or whether indeed there was any cause and effect at all -- maybe the
correlation was just a random outlier!), eventually, in some systems, the correlation can itself
become the cause. It has become a
[self-fulfulling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy).

So I wonder... can you use this observation to your advantage? Can you deliberately set up systems
of people to behave in self-reinforcing ways (or would that be considered manipulative and bad)?
Can you take a correlation without cause, and deliberately turn it into one which causes itself?
Can you create causation from correlation?

Can you, for example, make yourself successful by just asserting loudly that you are going to be
successful, and citing some unrelated correlation between yourself and winning?
