title: When correlation causes causation
---

We all know that correlation does not imply causation. But, as [XKCD says](http://xkcd.com/552/),
"it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing 'look over there'".

When human beings are part of the cause-and-effect loop, things get more complicated. Humans
often *want* to believe that a correlation is telling them something about causation, even if
their rational, right brain hemisphere is telling them that there is nothing there.

Humans sometimes just act irrationally, i.e. something which shouldn't *rationally* have an effect
on our behaviour actually does influence it nevertheless. But if cause and effect are irrationally
coupled, a lot of scientific principles start losing grip.

In systems which have a positive feedback loop, and which contain humans, this means you can
(to some extent) create the outcome you want just by asserting it and demonstrating a correlation.
If I can demonstrate a correlation, and point towards an effect, and get you to change your
behaviour based on this information, I have effectively created a causal relationship between
the correlation and the effect. The correlation has, in some sense, become the cause.

Markets -- financial markets in particular -- seem to have a lot of this kind of thing happening.
If enough people believe a stock price is going to go up, it will go up, because people buy.
If something has gone up in the past, lots of people have an interest in seeing it go up further,
so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Up to a point, of course, when people realise that
they had based everything on a false premise, and the market crashes.)

Does this mean you can systematically cause things to happen by pointing at correlations?
Can you create causation from correlation?

Ron Conway or Chris Sacca invests in your startup? Bam, instantly everyone else wants to get in
too, because they are known for achieving a better-than-average correlation between investments
and successes. Sure, they are great people, but lots of others are great too. It's not clear
whether their sixth sense is the causal link here. But lots of people seem to believe that there
*must be something* in their investment decisions, and follow them. Thus, correlation has created
causation.

Signalling effect of a degree from a good university: because in the past, having a degree from
Cambridge has been correlated with people doing a good job and being successful, having such a
degree increases your chances of being considered for exciting jobs in which you can make a
difference and be recognised as a success, which in turn strengthens the correlation.
