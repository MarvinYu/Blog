title: I didn't really enjoy Y Combinator
---

I didn't really enjoy our three months at [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/).

Let me clarify: none of that was YC's fault --- quite the opposite. They made the time bearable.
I don't doubt for a second that joining YC in Summer 2010 was the right choice. But our
experience of YC was different from the experience that the majority of YC startups get.

The difference? We had [already launched](http://blog.rapportive.com/the-accidental-launch).

You'd think that hey, it's fantastic to have launched, particularly as successfully as we did!
Well, yes, but the downside is that we spent the entire 3 months of YC (and probably another
month either side) doing the following:

* Answering many, many support emails and tweets
* Raising [our seed round](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/02/rapportive-funding/)
* Stopping our infrastructure from collapsing under our user growth
* Responding to press and bloggers
* Reading resumés and interviewing job candidates
* Fixing gnarly bugs in production
* Applying for visas, so that we could work in the US
* Attending YC dinners

By contrast, most YC startups spend their 3 months:

* Moving their product forward
* Attending YC dinners

Although all the things we were doing were valuable --- even spending so much time on support
is valuable, because we learnt a lot about our users, and we turned lots of people from annoyed
users into enthusiastic supporters --- it was incredibly frustrating. Our product barely moved
ahead at all in terms of features. And all the while, our YC batchmates were demoing new features
every week, and getting a massive high from the productive flow of developing their product at a
rapid pace.

So I am perhaps a bit envious of those who could move ahead rapidly and build their product
without having to worry about supporting users or keeping their database alive. On the other
hand, I am of course hugely grateful for our users who use and
[love our product](http://rapportive.com/buzz) every day. I wouldn't have it any other way.

Fortunately, we were not alone. At the YC office there is a whiteboard of somewhat iconic
status, which reminds every single YC founder of *"The Process"*: the observation that once
they've launched, the novelty will wear off, and they will find themselves in the
*"Trough of Sorrow"*. We know what the Trough of Sorrow looks like. I have just described it.
It's not very much fun.

But here is good news: Rapportive now seems to have journeyed on to the next phase,
we have made *"Releases of Improvement"*, and things are looking hopeful -- must be those
*"Wiggles of False Hope"*?. Hey, the money is in the bank, the visas are in our passports, the
infrastructure has got a lot more robust. We have released
[new features](http://blog.rapportive.com/grow-your-network-with-rapportive),
and lots of really exciting product development is in progress. We are once again moving our
product forward. People love what Rapportive is now, but their jaws would drop if they could
see what is coming. The hope is real. It's not just false. And we seem to have managed to avoid
the *"Crash of Ineptitude"* (or so I hope, at least).

Sometimes you just have to wade through a patch of mud, and there's no way round it. But as
long as you keep your eyes forward and keep moving, you'll get through it, and things will
brighten up.
