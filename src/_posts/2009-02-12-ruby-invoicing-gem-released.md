title: "Ruby Invoicing Gem released"
---

I have just made the first public release of a new open source project -- the
[Ruby Invoicing Framework](http://ept.github.com/invoicing/), a bunch of tools and a structure which
can be used inside commercial (web) applications to handle billing of customers, tax calculations,
and other financial matters.
[Full announcement and background story here](http://ept.github.com/invoicing/2009/02/12/ruby-invoicing-gem-version-0-1-released.html).

Some highlights from the announcement:

> After learning the basics of accounting, I still find it dead boring. And
> that is really the reason why I took the Bid for Wine code in January 2009 and started extracting a
> general-purpose finance handling framework out of it: I wanted to find a neat representation of the
> data, one which made both me as a developer happy and also satisfied the accountants; and I wanted
> to package it up so that I wouldn’t have to think about the financial stuff any more than
> necessary: I wanted to make it go away, not by ignoring it, but by automating it as much as
> possible, and by explaining it in a way which doesn’t require you to know any accounting jargon.
>
> What I have now released, the *Invoicing gem version 0.1.0*, is the combination of all the
> experience we gathered while developing Bid for Wine with several weeks of my full-time work.
> Despite the young version number, this is already a pretty solid and stable framework. I waited with
> the first release until I felt that the core API was well enough thought out that I could minimize
> the number of backwards-incompatible changes in the upcoming minor versions up to 1.0.
