LinkedIn, with over 300 million members, has surmounted some interesting scalability challenges.
Many core components of LinkedIn's data infrastructure are open source, so you can benefit from them
too. This talk will give an overview of the approaches and tools that have proved successful at
massive scale.

This talk was co-organised by the
[Budapest Big Data Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Meetup-Budapest/events/208253412/) and the
[Budapest Data Science Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/budapest_data_science/events/212171402/).
