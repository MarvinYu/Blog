On Wednesday I went to the
[Future of Mobile](http://www.future-of-mobile.com/) conference in London. It was an exciting event
-- lots of people had high hopes, in particular for the future of data services on mobile devices
(i.e. the internet). Some of my main take-home messages were:

* The mobile market is HUGE. Seriously. Billions of people worldwide have mobile
phones, and more people worldwide access the web from mobile devices than from desktop or laptop
computers. By 2010, half the world's population is expected to be subscribed to the mobile web. A
lot of this is driven by developing countries, where mobile is a far better solution for
communication than a fixed-line telephone infrastructure. But it is also a growing trend in the
developed
world.
* A great user experience is absolutely essential if you want to get people to use
your services mobile. The mobile user's attention is extremely limited: unlike on a computer or a
television, where people are more likely to patiently try to come to terms with bad usability,
mobile users have plenty of other things to do. If they can't immediately and very quickly find or
achieve what they want, they are gone immediately. Mobile content must therefore be extremely
clearly and intelligently structured, presented in an engaging way, glanceable, simple, and be fluid
to interact
with.
* Communication is key. People want to talk, create, share, explore -- not just
passively consume. A mobile is always with you it, it where your life is happening, it is a point of
creation and lies in a rich context. The future possiblities for the social use of mobiles is
something we can only just begin to envisage.

Amongst the speakers, possibly the most
keenly awaited was David Burke of Google, who was the first to present Google's new
[Android](http://code.google.com/android/) platform in Europe. See
[this post](http://onandroid.com/2007/11/15/dave-burke-presents-at-future-of-mobile/) for more on
his presentation.

Finally an interesting quote, very much in rhythm with the drum I am
bashing:

>Â "Mobile users are ready and willing to engage with their favourite brands on mobile devices."
