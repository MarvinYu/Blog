title: "Update on Go Test It"
---

[GoTestIt, my company's product for automated functional testing of web apps across different browsers](http://go-test.it),
has been progressing in leaps and bounds. We
[launched at Future of Web Apps](http://go-test.it/blog/2009/10/05/launch-at-future-of-web-apps.html),
only about 7 months after the first line of code was written. Since then, lots of people have signed up
and given us loads of positive feedback on the service.

Go Test It now has its own
[Twitter account](http://twitter.com/GoTestIt) and
[a shiny new blog](http://go-test.it/blog), to which
[you can subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/gotestit) for product updates and useful testing
tips. I will keep this blog as my personal space, for general thoughts on software development, and
I won't inundate you with marketing messages, honestly! :-)

On a personal level, you might recall that
[I was going to start a PhD](/2009/03/31/doing-a-phd/) around this time. That was back at the
beginning of this year, when I didn't know whether Go Test It was really going to go
anywhere.

Well, it turned out that Go Test It is now going really well, and doing it part-time
alongside a PhD is just not going to work. We need to keep our competitive head-start and continue
innovating; we need to support our customer base and work on growing further; we need to continue
working on the product to make sure it is absolutely rock-solid and delightfully simple to use. It
is important that we continue going ahead with full force.

I have therefore decided to withdraw
from the PhD, and to work on Go Test It full-time. Academia can wait; customers can't. It is great
that I can now focus fully on making Go Test It the obvious choice for web developers' testing
needs.
