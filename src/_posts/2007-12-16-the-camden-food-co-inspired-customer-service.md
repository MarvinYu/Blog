Yesterday I was travelling through St. Pancras station, and walked into a branch of the
[Camden Food Company](http://www.camdenfoodco.com/) in need of some supper. When I went to pay I
offered my card, because I was low on cash -- only to be told that they didn't accept cards. I was
just working out which of the items I would have to return in order to have sufficient cash to pay,
when the cashier offered to write off the Â£2.60 of the bill which I was lacking.

I could hardly
believe my ears. In this age of Ryanair and similar mega-low-cost consumer brands (where you get
what you pay for, and companies nevertheless hide additional charges behind every corner just to
catch you out), being offered such an immediate and unquestioning discount was almost beyond my
imagination. I was, of course, very happy (being spared dragging my luggage to another shop where I
could get the rest of my meal, via a cash machine) and thought I should voice this appreciation
publicly.

Actually I'm not sure I'm doing the Camden Food Company a service by apparently saying
that you can get free food there by trying to pay with card and not having enough cash. That's not
what I'm trying to say, and please don't go there trying to exploit them deliberately. What I'm
saying is that I am impressed with the ability of a consumer brand to be so flexible and
accommodating.

In a highly competitive industry like fast food, where customers are
brand-promiscuous, any measure which will make customers more loyal to a particular brand is likely
to be very valuable. Now that I am literally indebted to the Camden Food Company, I am a lot more
likely to go there again. It makes perfect economic sense too.

Needless to say, the meal tasted
very good. Part of that was probably the subjective effect of just having experienced some
unexpected, inspired customer service. But I'm sure that by any objective standard it would have
been very good too.
