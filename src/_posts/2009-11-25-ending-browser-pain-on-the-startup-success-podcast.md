I was lucky to get a chance to be interviewed by the great
[Bob Walsh](http://twitter.com/BobWalsh), founder of
[StartupToDo](http://startuptodo.com), and author of the
[Web Startup Success Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Success-Guide-Books-Professionals/dp/1430219858)
([review by Joel Spolsky](http://www.47hats.com/2009/07/joel-spolsky-on-the-web-startup-success-guide/),
[review by Neil Davidson](http://blog.businessofsoftware.org/2009/08/the-web-startup-success-guide---a-book-review.html)).

The interview is for the
[Startup Success Podcast](http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/), a series of shows providing a
wealth of useful information and inspiration for startups. In this episode,
[Patrick Foley](http://blogs.msdn.com/patrick_foley/) talks about his visit to the
[Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC)](http://microsoftpdc.com/), and I talk about
[Go Test It](http://go-test.it/) – what it is, how it works, why we built it, where it is going in
future. There’s even a special discount in there! :)

Head over now to the Startup Success Podcast and
[listen to the episode](http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/show-46-ending-browser-pain-martin-kleppmann-go-test-it/)!
(The interview with me starts at about 15 minutes in.)
