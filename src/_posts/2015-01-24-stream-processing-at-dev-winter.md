Abstract
--------

Some people call it stream processing. Others call it Event Sourcing or CQRS. Some even call it
Complex Event Processing. Sometimes, such self-important buzzwords are just smoke and mirrors,
invented by consultants to sell you stuff. But sometimes, they contain a kernel of wisdom which can
really help us design better systems.

In this talk, we will go in search of the wisdom behind the buzzwords. We will discuss how event
streams can help make your application more scalable, more reliable and more maintainable. Founded
in the experience of building large-scale data systems at LinkedIn, and implemented in open source
projects like [Apache Samza](http://samza.incubator.apache.org/), stream processing is finally
coming of age.
