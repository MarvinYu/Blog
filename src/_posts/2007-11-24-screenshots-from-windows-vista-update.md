title: "Screenshots from Windows Vista Update"
---

Jimmy sent me some screenshots of Windows Vista which exemplify
[my complaints about unclear labelling of
buttons](/2007/07/19/yes-no-cancel-causes-aspirin-sales-to-soar/) -- a usability problem which
occurs so frequently that I've named this whole blog after it. He was running Windows Update, which
was installing a bunch of software
updates:

<p
align="center"><a href="/2007/11/winupdate1.png" title="Screenshot of Windows Update
running"><img src="/2007/11/winupdate1.png" alt="Screenshot of Windows Update running"
/></a></p>

It turned out that he didn't actually want to install those updates now,
so he hit the *"Stop installation"* button. Up pops a dialog box:

<p style="text-align:
center"><a href="/2007/11/winupdate2.png" title="Screenshot of dialog box: Windows needs your
permission to continue. Continue,
cancel."><img src="/2007/11/winupdate2.png" alt="Screenshot of dialog box: Windows needs your
permission to continue. Continue, cancel."
/></a></p>

Now what does this mean? Does *continue* mean *"continue stopping the
installation"*, or does it mean *"continue the installation"*? If we press *cancel*, will this
cancel the request to stop installing updates, or will it cancel the installation process itself?
And what does the red X button in the corner do? (The temptation to press X in cases like this is
huge: I consider it to mean "shut up, go away, I don't want to think about what you are asking
me".)

But there is still hope: a *"Details"* button, which will surely reveal
the answer and tell us what button to press. So we click
*"Details"*:

<p style="text-align:
center"><a href="/2007/11/winupdate3.png" title="Screenshot: the details of the operation are
revealed to be a string of letters and
numbers."><img src="/2007/11/winupdate3.png" alt="Screenshot: the details of the operation
are revealed to be a string of letters and numbers." /></a></p>

Oh, that was really useful. You know, we love hexadecimal numbers. Thank you, Microsoft!

But Microsoft are not the only offenders
in this regard.

similar problems with OpenOffice.
