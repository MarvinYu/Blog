This is not a conference talk (I just don't have time to customise my blog right now, so I'm listing
it as a talk for lack of a better category).

As a [resident](https://www.recurse.com/residents), I will be spending two weeks full-time at the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a community and educational retreat for people who want
to get better at programming. They are an excellent group of people, and I am lucky to get to spend
two weeks with them.
