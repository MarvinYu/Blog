This afternoon I gave a talk at
[BarcampLondon5](http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon5) about how we are using the
[Selenium web test automation tool](http://selenium.openqa.org/), amongst other things, for
[continuous integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)/regression
testing on the
[Bid for Wine project which I wrote about
before](/2008/09/22/bid-for-wine-online-wine-auctions-coming-soon.html).

Here are the slides from my
presentation:

I had some very good conversations with several people after this presentation, amongst others
[Jonathan Melhuish](http://jonathanmelhuish.com/) who pointed out that about two years ago there was
a start-up called Autoriginate, founded by
[Patrick Lightbody](http://lightbody.net/blog/), which aimed to provide a hosted on-demand
Selenium-based testing service called HostedQA. HostedQA does not appear to exist any more in its
current form, and I only found
[a bit of information about Autoriginate and HostedQA in the Wayback
Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20070206184828/http://blog.autoriginate.com/).

I'm not
completely sure what happened to HostedQA, but the evidence suggests that Autoriginate was acquired
by
[Gomez](http://www.gomez.com/) and became what is now their
[Reality Check XF](http://www.gomez.com/products/functional-testing.php) product.

We use Selenium
quite a bit now, and I know that it's a bit of a hassle to set up so that it works neatly; so one
might think that I should be attracted to buying their solution. I don't mind paying for tools which
make us more productive (we pay for
[Highrise](http://www.highrisehq.com/) and
[FogBugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/), for example), but somehow Gomez looks very unappealing
to me. At least part of that is because they don't provide pricing information on their website, and
don't have a sign-up button. A while ago I was considering them and actually tried quite hard to
find out more from them. They were not particularly responsive by email, and they made me speak to
two of their people in a phone conference for 20 minutes before they would tell me how much they
charged! Maybe that sort of sales strategy works when selling to large enterprises, but for small
development houses like ourselves, the attractiveness is zero. Bizarre. Maybe their technology is
fine (if they did acquire Patrick Lightbody's work it may even be very good), but for me they are
irrelevant because of their sales methods.
