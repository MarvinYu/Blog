Yesterday I went to see the unveiling of the
[Corpus Clock, also known as the Chronophage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronophage), on the
outside of the new Taylor Library of
[Corpus Christi College Cambridge](http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/), where I studied. The short
unveiling ceremony was led by none other than
[Professor Stephen Hawking](http://www.hawking.org.uk/), and has
[already](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7625815.stm)

The
Chonophage is absolutely astonishing. I can only recommend seeing it yourself, because this video
doesn't really do it justice, but it's the best I could find so
far.

The Chronophage is a beast which eats away time. Dr John Taylor conceived it as a
memento mori, a challenging piece of public art, and simultaneously a feat of mechanical
engineering. You can read up about the details in the [Wikipedia article about the Corpus
Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Clock) which I have also been editing; here I just want
to make a few personal comments.

**Who is John Taylor?**

An air of mystery surrounds this clock
and John Taylor, who led the design of the clock and funded it. I am sure that after seeing this
clock there will be many voices shouting that he is a genius and/or madman, and cast judgements
about him -- without really knowing who this man actually is.

I have met John Taylor on a few
occasions, and still I only know little about him. When I was at Corpus, several of the scholarships
I received were funded by his generosity (so I probably speak with a bit of bias in his favour, but
also with a bit more insight than the average journalist). From time to time, the college would
organise evening socials at which John could meet some of the students he was supporting. These
evenings were an opportunity for young people like myself to recognise that our work and life was
part of a wider context, with many stories and human personalities involved, not faceless
institutions and anonymous pounds sterling but rich and complex backgrounds. We could learn to be
grateful.

At one of these dinner parties, I spent a long time talking to John. I don't recall
exactly when that was, but it was probably in my second year in college, about three and a half
years ago -- he must have already been in the middle of designing the Chronophage. John explained to
us how he made his fortune: first by examining the design of electrical connectors in electric
kettles and figuring out how he could shave one penny off the production costs by reducing the
amount of material, and of course continue selling the result at the same price. One penny times
many many electric kettles sold, that already paid off well. He continued to make further
improvements in the field of electric kettles, and apparently the cordless kettle (with the round
base, onto which you can place the kettle in any angle) is his invention.

You may think electric
kettles are a boring subject, but with John Taylor talking about them, you can't help being
fascinated. After all, they are very much part of our day-to-day lives. He talks about tuning the
[bi-metallic thermostat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-metallic_strip) to achieving a perfect
3-second hard boil in Europe (once the water goes into hard boil, it should take 3 seconds before
the thermostat switches off, otherwise the steam causes unwanted condensation in the kitchen); in
Asia, it is tuned differently, because the water should be kept on hard boil for close to a minute
to ensure germs are killed off. In the UK, electric kettles have been popular for a long time, but
they didn't really catch on in Germany; this was due to the popular opinion amongst traditional
[*Hausfrauen*](http://dict.leo.org/ende?lang=en&search=Hausfrau) who found the heating
element 'dirty' when calcium deposits accumulated on it. Taylor figured out that the heating element
could be concealed beneath a flat kettle base, making it much easier to clean and descale, and
electric kettle sales took off in Germany too.

These stories are about engineering and business
only on the surface. Underneath, they are about people. About simple, everyday lives.

I mentioned
to John that I was considering the idea of starting a business, and he was pleased. His advice to me
was to work for myself, and not become a slave of other people. Don't borrow money from the banks,
otherwise you become the banks' slave -- first make profits, then fund growth out of those profits.
He was particularly negative about banks.

**John Taylor and Corpus**

John is a very humble and
retiring person -- absolutely not what one would expect of somebody at his level of success. I found
it positive and encouraging to see that you could be a successful entrepreneur not by being loud and
self-aggrandising, but by quietly figuring out how to improve people's lives. He is not from a
particularly affluent background, he was not even particularly good at university (he graduated with a
[2.2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#Lower_second-class_honours),
if I remember correctly) and he didn't expect to change the world. He didn't choose to work on
particularly sexy things; instead he made little improvements to the lowly electric kettle. He
doesn't push himself forward, as far as I know he hasn't published anything, doesn't have a personal
website or a LinkedIn profile or an article on Wikipedia, and I suspect that before this thing with
the Corpus Clock the press had never even heard of him. (A PR company organised the Chronophage
unveiling ceremony and surrounding events, and I suspect that it took them a lot of effort to
persuade him to appear and speak a few words in public at this occasion; my guess is that he would
have much rather just quietly watched from the back.)

The Corpus Clock is just a small part of a
grand plan which connects Corpus Christi College and John Taylor. A plan which involves rather a lot
of money, but has a very personal level too. I think John loved his college years very dearly, and
this has left him with a particular affection for the college. Also, from the theme of the clock it
is obvious that mortality is important to him. It must have become clear to him that the right use
of his fortune, in the years which remain to him, will involve his old love, the college.

Taylor
has been pouring money into the college for several years now; he has contributed an estimated
£2.5m towards the new college library, named Taylor Library in his honour; the clock came to about
£1m; not to mention numerous undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships, travel grants he has
sponsored, and probably a lot more which I don't even know about. His work has been very much behind
the scenes, hidden; probably almost every Corpus student in the past 8 years or so has benefited
from Taylor's contributions in some way, but only few have actually met him. He is informally known
as the 'Kettle Man', but he is rarely talked about, because he never seeks public attention. My
housemate Naomi's PhD is being paid for by him; so were my composition studies 2 years ago. Others
benefit from improved facilities and much more, probably unaware of his activity or even taking it
for granted. It is almost as though Taylor's love for the college was a very secret
one.

Unfortunately, I think, the college only started requiting Taylor's affection once he had
started giving money and they realised just quite how deep pockets he had, which is sad because it
does not seem heartfelt. Institutions like Corpus evoke feelings of fondness amongst many of their
old members because of the wonderful community they provide to students. At the same time, they have
to function economically, and although Corpus is fortunate to have substantial assets, it still has
to watch its cashflow carefully (a lot of the assets are in things like land, buildings, silverware,
and port... and I narrowly escape a terrible pun about liquid and illiquid assets here). Funding for
academic institutions is always short, and even comparatively well-off colleges or universities cry
out for donations and other sources of funding. So it's not surprising that Corpus was happy to
quickly enter into a hot love affair with Taylor's money, but I sincerely hope that they are in it
for the love, not just the money.

For John Taylor, there may be an element of hoping to achieve
immortality through becoming one of the college's top benefactors. However, as I understand it, he
sees a lot more depth in this relationship than simply personal gratification. From conversations
with fellows of Corpus I gather that there is a kind of long-term 'master plan': to support students
to realise their full potential, in the hope that like John himself, they will go out into the world
to make a difference, which earns them a lot of money, some of which they will then feed back into
the college to support the next generation of students. He wants to be the trigger for a continuing
cycle of progress and positive change.

Therefore, if we see Taylor's bust in the Taylor Library, or
pay our tuition fees from his money, I *don't* believe that he wants us to think "oh, what a
wonderful and generous man John Taylor is". That would completely miss the point. No, what we should
be thinking is: *"ah, what a good idea he had: I should be grateful and motivated by his support,
and when I have developed further a few years down the line, I will remember his gift and will give
something back"*.

**Some personal comments**

Of course the entrepreneurial view resonates with me.
I believe that a good education is a great starting position to go out into the world, make a
difference and do something worthwhile, be it changing people's lives for the better, or making a
fortune, or whatever. Moreover, I too am fond of my old college, mainly because of the wonderful
people I met and the profound experiences in which I was allowed to share there. I am grateful of
all the college has given me, and it seems quite natural to me that if I was through some bizarre
coincidence to become successful and wealthy, I would give something back to the college. Already
now I try to return some of the favour by getting involved in some of the college teaching and
supervising undergraduate students.

But there are also things I ponder about. Some subjects have
more of a tendency to generate money than others. Law, management, science and engineering have a
tendency of being good money makers; history, philosophy, arts and humanities are equally important
for our culture, identity and society, but they tend not to be rewarded as much in monetary terms.
If money is to become an increasingly important driving force in education and academia, we must be
very careful that the revenue-weak subjects don't get neglected.

Although I value competition,
incentives and support for those with particular abilities, I strongly believe we must also be
careful that the system always remains inclusive. When institutions strongly rely on alumni feeding
funds back to their educators, there is a danger of positive feedback loops, which makes some
organisations extremely wealthy while others are starved. Judging from historic experience, we often
see people from unremarkable backgrounds going forward to do remarkable things, and it would be
foolish for a society to prevent such social mobility by creating exclusivity.

I don't want the UK
to end up like the US, where many universities are run very much as businesses, whose professional
fundraisers squeeze every available dollar out of their alumni while the university still charges
*obscene* tuition fees to students. Universities should remain places of reflection and wisdom, they
should treasure our culture, our understanding of the world and our humanity; the purpose of a
business is to make money, but that is not the purpose of a university.

In Europe of the Middle
Ages, society took many steps backwards from antique times, and monasteries were pretty much the
only places were culture, education and learning lived on. In the renaissance, these values
gradually returned to the wider population, forming the basis for the social progress which has
brought us to our current high culture.

In the older Cambridge colleges you can still feel a bit of
that monastic tradition today, reminding us of the importance to treasure that culture and learning,
to keep it as something precious, to be grateful, and at the same time to constantly move forward
and progress, deepening our understanding of the world and ourselves.

**What's this got to do with the Corpus Clock?**

Which brings us back to the starting point, the Chronophage, now part of the
same walls which are the home to both all the precious learning and also all the money matters
mentioned above.

It is modern art? That's right, and it fits in nicely right next to the wonderful
building in which I lived for a year, which dates from the 14th Century.

It is expensive? True, but
amazing things rarely come free; think of all the artists, craftsmen and engineers who helped to
make it happen; think of what it might cost to
[build a cathedral](/2008/03/30/on-the-importance-of-ambition.html).

It is an astonishing piece of
engineering? Indeed, and I'm delighted that we can still celebrate and marvel at a mechanical
device in this age of electronic computers.

It is a piece of history? Yes, it is a tribute to the
greatest of clockmakers hundreds of years ago, but it is still novel, it is inspiring, it is built
to last, and being a clock, it is also anchored in the present.

It is terrifying and challenging?
Absolutely, because no progress is made without challenge.

It reminds us that we're all going to
die? Correct, and more optimistically, it reminds us that we should try to do something good with
the time we have before that event.
