You know you're doing something good if someone you've never met before spontaneously comes up to
you and asks: "Are you with Rapportive? Just wanted to say that I love it."

He could recognise me because we had exchanged emails, and he had therefore seen my photo in
Rapportive next to my email.

This is our social future. We're busy creating it.
