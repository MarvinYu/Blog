I've just worked out how you could make a 3G iPhone yourself, even adding GPS support, and still get
away with a lower cost than buying a regular iPhone. The solution:

* Get an iPod Touch (from £199).
* Get a Symbian smartphone, such as the N95, with an internet plan (on 3 you'd pay
about £34 per month over 18 months for a N95 and a tariff roughly equivalent to O2's iPhone
tariff).
* Download
[JoikuSpot](http://www.joikuspot.com/aboutJoikuSpot.php) and install it on the N95. Use it to create
an ad-hoc wireless network, and connect the iPod Touch to that
network.
* Voilà. Total cost is about £811 over 18 months (compared to the iPhone total
cost of £899), you get 3G or even HSDPA, and you get a whole additional handset with Nokia's
awesome features.

JoikuSpot is still a bit limited -- rather than just routing packets,
it proxies HTTP traffic and doesn't support anything else, so e.g. IMAP isn't going to work for the
time being. I hope that will get fixed soon. I tested JoikuSpot briefly for plain web traffic on my
E65 and it seems to be working.

I'm not going to rush out and buy all those things now, I just find
this situation curious.
