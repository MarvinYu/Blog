Abstract
--------

We examine the security of collaboration systems, where several users access and contribute to some
shared resource, document, or database. To protect such systems against malicious servers, we can
build upon existing secure messaging protocols that provide end-to-end security. However, if we want
to ensure the consistency of the shared data in the presence of malicious users, we require features
that are not available in existing messaging protocols. We investigate the protocol failures that
may arise when a new collaborator is added to a group, and discuss approaches for enforcing the
integrity of the shared data.
