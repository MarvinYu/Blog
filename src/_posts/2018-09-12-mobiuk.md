Abstract
--------

We introduce Automerge, a JavaScript library for data synchronisation between mobile devices such as
laptop computers and smartphones. It allows users to read and modify data even while their device is
offline, and it automatically merges changes made concurrently on different devices. Unlike most
existing data synchronisation systems, Automerge does not require data to be sent via a centralised
server, but rather allows local and peer-to-peer networks to be used.
