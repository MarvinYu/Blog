Mobile internet usage is one of those areas which is hyped a lot, but it's actually pretty hard to
lay your hands on some real figures detailing the number of users. In this week's
[NMA](http://www.nma.co.uk/), there's an
[article by Tim Barber of Continental
Research](http://www.nma.co.uk/Articles/36864/Don't+ignore+the+biggest+group+of+mobile+users.html)
which gives a few useful figures to quote.

If you add up the figures, you see that there are
currently a total of 7.4 million mobile internet users in the UK, which corresponds to 12% of all
mobile phone users. I think that's a pretty impressive figure already -- it shows that mobile
internet use isn't just a toy for a small number of geeks, but it's actually fast en route to
mainstream adoption. (I don't have an up-to-date growth figure, but I do know that from 2006--2007
the number of page views from mobile devices went up by 16%, according to the Mobile Data
Association.)

Speaking of geeks, the data from Continental Research breaks the population into four
rough categories: whether or not they are interested in technology, and whether or not they are
interested in style. Considering just the former
criterion:

* Those interested in technology (the 'geeks') constitute 25% of mobile users, and
of these people, 28% use the mobile internet. In this group, we therefore have 4.4 million mobile
internet users.
* Those not interested in technology constitute 75% of mobile users, and of these
people, 6% use the mobile internet. In this group, we therefore have 3 million mobile internet
users.

Spot something? A techie is 4 or 5 times more likely to use the internet on a
mobile phone than a non-techie. However, the reality is that there are also 3 times as many
non-techies as there are techies. This means they almost cancel out -- right now, there are  already
plenty of people using mobile internet services even though they don't care about gadgets and
technology toys.

This is pretty good news: it shows that the general population has a genuine need
which mobile internet access can address. It's not just a toy, and we don't simply use it just
because we can. It's actually something which can make our lives better.

Viewed in terms of
[Gartner's Hype Cycle](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=495475), right now, the mobile web and
mobile internet are stepping out of the *Trough of Disillusionment* (into which they fell with the
failure of WAP to match expectations) onto the *Slope of Enlightenment*.

I think this calls for a graph.
