title: "Invoicing gem at Rails Underground"
---

I spoke today at the
[Rails Underground conference](http://www.rails-underground.com/) on the
[Ruby Invoicing Gem](http://ept.github.com/invoicing/), the financial transactions library which we
have been developing as a side-effect of our work on
[Go Test It](http://go-test.it/) and some client projects. Unlike
[my previous talk at LRUG](/2009/04/24/my-talk-on-the-invoicing-gem-02.html), this was a more
slides-based talk with more on general background and motivation. The
[slides are now up on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/martinkleppmann/invoicing-gem-sales-payments-in-your-app)
and also embedded below:

**Update (28 July 2009)**: I'm pleased to say that my talk also
[received 4.11 out of 5 points on SpeakerRate](http://speakerrate.com/talks/1269-invoicing-gem-sales-payments-in-your-app),
clearly above the average of 3.92 out of 5 for that conference.
