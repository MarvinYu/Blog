I spoke today at the
[Rails Underground conference](http://www.rails-underground.com/) on the
[Ruby Invoicing Gem](http://ept.github.com/invoicing/), the financial transactions library which we
have been developing as a side-effect of our work on
[Go Test It](http://go-test.it/) and some client projects. Unlike
[my previous talk at LRUG](/2009/04/24/my-talk-on-the-invoicing-gem-02.html), this was a more
slides-based talk with more on general background and motivation. The
[slides are now up on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/martinkleppmann/invoicing-gem-sales-payments-in-your-app).
