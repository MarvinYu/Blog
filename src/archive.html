<h1>Archive</h1>

<p>This is the full archive of posts on Martin Kleppmann's blog (formerly Yes/No/Cancel).
My thinking has been developing rapidly, and some of the older stuff is quite embarrassing
to my present self. So please treat it with the appropriate scepticism :)</p>

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}: <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
