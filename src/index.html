<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I'm Martin Kleppmann, software engineer, entrepreneur, author and speaker.
I co-founded <a href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>
(<a href="http://blog.rapportive.com/rapportive-acquired-by-linkedin">acquired</a>
by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> in 2012) and Go Test It (acquired by 
<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">Red Gate Software</a> in 2009).
At the moment I'm
<a href="/2014/09/15/writing-a-book.html">writing a book</a> for
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>, called
<a href="http://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>,
while also working as a researcher at the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory</a>.</p>

<p>I care about making stuff that people want, great people, a culture of respect and empathy,
clarity of thinking, marvellous user experiences, maintainable code and scalable architectures.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear from you, so please leave comments, or feel free to
<a rel="author" href="/contact.html">contact me directly</a>.</p>
