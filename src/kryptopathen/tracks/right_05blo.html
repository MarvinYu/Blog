<i>Verse 1</i>
<br>
One night I was a monkey<br>
I was sitting on a table<br>
but I couldn't move at all<br>
for I was tied up with a cable,<br>
then I panicked and I realized<br>
my fighting was in vain,<br>
there were fifteen human animals<br>
longing for my brain.<br>
<br>
<i>Verse 2</i>
<br>
One day was like each other<br>
and my cage was dark and tiny<br>
all I ate was coke 'n chocolate<br>
got my teeth cleaned bright and shiny.<br>
I was far too fat to stand<br>
got almost strangled by my chain<br>
and the image of the forest<br>
vanished from my brain.<br>
<br>
<i>Verse 3</i>
<br>
I saw a monkey's mother<br>
with her young one always with her<br>
and the young one must have heard<br>
all the whips that they still give her.<br>
She was all the world to him<br>
but all he could feel was pain.<br>
So they opened up his head<br>
to eat his lovely brain.<br>
