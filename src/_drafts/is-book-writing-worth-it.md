Writing a book: is it worth it?
===============================

"I hate writing; I love having written."

[Writing a book to discover](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/724939636284514304).

Let's try estimating the value created by a book.

About 10,000 people have bought my book so far. Let's say that two thirds of them intend to read it
but actually haven't got round to it yet. Of those who have read it, let's say that one third were
able to actually apply some of the ideas in the book, and two thirds read it purely out of interest.
So let's say conservatively that 10% of people who bought the book, that is 1,000 people, have
applied it for some useful purpose.

What might such a useful purpose look like? In the case of my book, much of it is about making
architectural decisions. If you get them right, you can build some amazing systems; if you get them
wrong, you have to spend ages painfully digging yourself out of a mess that you got yourself into.

It's hard to quantify that, but let's say that the people who applied ideas from the book avoided
a bad decision that would have taken them one month of engineering time to rectify. (I'd actually
love to claim that the time saving is much higher, but let's be conservative in our estimates.)
Thus, the 1,000 readers who applied the knowledge freed up an estimated 1,000 months, or 83 years,
of engineering time to spend on things that are more useful than digging yourself out of a mess.

If I spend 3 years writing a book, and it saves other people 83 years of time in aggregate, that is
almost 30x leverage. If we assume an average engineering salary on the order of $100k (low for the
Bay Area, high for everywhere else), that's $8M of value created. As more people read the book, that
number is only going to go up.

Am I a [10x engineer](https://twitter.com/peterseibel/status/512615519934230528) yet?

My apologies if that calculation comes across as obscenely self-congratulatory; that is not my
intention.

I see writing a book as an activity that
[creates more value than it captures](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html):
that is, the estimated $8M of value created is many times greater than the income I or the publisher
generate from sales of the book, or ever expect to generate in future. And that's ok: that's the way
I want it to be.

Note that "creating more value than you capture" does not imply you should capture no value at all,
and work for free. It just means the money you extract should be in reasonable proportion to the
value you create. You have got to eat, so you still have to somehow make the work economically viable.

Fortunately, a book is still something that people are willing to pay for, and so it is possible to
extract *some* of the value that it creates, in the form of sales and royalties. This is not at all
something you can take for granted. For example, there are open source projects that [plausibly
claim to create millions of dollars of value](http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/08/throwing-in-the-towel/)
for their users, and yet, getting paid to work on such an open source project is difficult.

In theory, if you work on open source you might be able to capture some of the value you create
in the form of higher consulting fees or suchlike, but often it doesn't work out that way. Often, work
on open source is simply
[unpaid labour](http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community) --
it creates significant value for others, but not much for the creators. 

It [is possible](http://www.mikeperham.com/2016/01/05/contributed-systems-2015/) to make a good
living out of open source software, but it's hard: you have to really run it as a business, not just
write the code -- that means marketing, sales, support, and other activities that are valuable, but
that most software engineers would consider tedious.

By contrast, if you write a book with a publisher like O'Reilly, you can focus mostly on just
writing the book. I don't need to negotiate distribution deals, handle refund requests, or set up
stalls at conferences -- they do all of that.  Not to mention all the editing, reviewing, and design
effort that goes into a book. Of course the publisher take a cut, but I think it's a fair deal,
since they really do a lot of work.

Part 2: How to write a book

Cloudbleed was several months ago, and so far I have avoided pontificating on the matter.

If you're considering writing a book, I would suggest starting by writing extended blog posts, and
seeing what kind of response you get from readers. That was how I got into writing: I had ideas that
I wanted to articulate, so I wrote them up on http://martin.kleppmann.com/ and they turned out to be
popular. As the blog posts kept getting longer (some over 4,000 words), I realised that "this is
hardly a blog post, it's more like half a chapter from a book", and so I started mapping out what
such a book would look like. Given the popularity of my blog posts, it was fairly easy to get
publishers interested.

In terms of pay-off, it really varies depending on how popular your book turns out to be. Like
starting a band with friends and hoping to become rock stars, it's difficult to predict in advance
what will be a hit and what will flop. It's wise to keep your financial expectations very low,
because most books sell poorly. Mine has ended up selling quite well, through a combination of luck,
addressing a market need, and lots of effort promoting the book (e.g. by giving many conference
talks, and social media). As a result, I can now get quite lucrative consulting gigs, which make it
worthwhile in retrospect. But such success is unfortunately not guaranteed, even if your manuscript
is excellent.

I would say that if you want to write a book, the primary reason should be the learning experience
that the writing process will provide for yourself: when you finish writing, you will understand the
topic very well yourself, because you've had to explain it to readers in great detail. Prestige or
financial reward should be secondary, because they are not guaranteed. Writing a book is a big time
commitment (I probably spent about 2.5 years of full-time equivalent work on my book, spread out
over 4 years), and it could well be that you can do other things in that time (e.g. working on an
important project in industry) that would be more rewarding, more prestigious, and more impactful.

Hope that perspective is somewhat useful.
